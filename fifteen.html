	Final Project: S2
 Overview of solution: this game was made by using youtube tutorials on the various pseudo code and creating various id's and classes to be as organized as possible;
 Key design features for the HTML page includes the div component that holds the puzzle as suggested
Testing for the HTML was trying out the different colors and trying to find the right image, I still ran into some issues with the contrast of colors, but I kept it simple due to comprimising team mates-->

		<h1>Christmas in 15: Puzzle Game</h1>

		<p class="description">
			The goal of this puzzle is to un-jingle these cookies so you dont come to dinner empty handed! Your seat at Christmas dinner depends on it! Organize the 15 squares (make it to the grocery store before they close for the next 24 hours) by making the right moves within the board and arrange the 14 movable pieces so the empty space is in the 15th slot.  How quickly can you solve it and make it the grocery store?

			american  puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely credited with creating the puzzle <br>
			indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented it.  The puzzle was actually created around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, NY
